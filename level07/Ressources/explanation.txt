1 - In our home directory we find the executable "level07". When executing, we see the output "level07". 
We check usual things like strace and ltrace to see what could be inside of this file. There are two interesting things inside of ltrace, we see "getenv("LOGNAME") = "level07"" and system("/bin/echo level07 "level07.

2 - We try to change the LOGNAME, to see if the output changes when we run the program. And indeed, the program prints what is inside of LOGNAME.

3 - We now know, that we can change LOGNAME to whatever we want and that th program "level07" will take it into account.
To go one step further, we set LOGNAME="`getflag`", but we get an error : 
	"Check flag.Here is your token :
	sh: 2: Syntax error: ")" unexpected".
4 - To parse getflag from within the program level07, we have to either put LOGNAME="\`getflag\`" or LOGNAME=echo && getflag.

5 - We execute the program and we get the flag! fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
