We already saw in level00 that in the /etc/passwd file (General user details) that the password entry of Username level01 had a weird value starting with 42.

This password entry in the /etc/passwd file is uncommon, since usually they are stored in /etc/shadow.

The password is hashed (from the hash appareance and our current informations, looks like classic DES crypt algorithm)
42hDRfypTqqnw=crypt(secret_pw)

We recover information about the crypt algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(C))

Crypt uses a salt, the 2 first characters of the hashed string are the salt (here, the salt is then 42, what a surprise!)
42hDRfypTqqnw=crypt(secret_pw, salt=42)

DES crypt also truncates the password to eight characters, so we know we only have to bruteforce through max 8 characters!

we use the openssl library to try to crack the hash through a bruteforce attack
