1 - When logging into level05, we get a prompt "You have new mail." which indicates to check the /var/mail/ folder. And indeed, we find a "level05" file which contains "*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05"

2 - That looks like cron! The first parameter tells us that the command "su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver"" is executed each 2 minutes.

3 - We check what is inside of "/usr/sbin/openarenaserver" to see what is executed each 2 minutes. Each file in "/opt/openarenaserver/" is being executed and then directly removed. 

4 - We realize that we have write rights in "/opt/openarenaserver/" and add a file which includes "getflag". Indeed, this file gets executed and deleted after 2 minutes. But we can't see the output of the file we created.

5 - Since the output does not get reflected, we create a new file in "/opt/openarenaserver/", this time we write into it: "getflag > /tmp/text.txt". 

6 - In the following two minutes we check the /tmp/text.txt file and voila, we have the flag.
