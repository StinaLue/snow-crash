We found the file "level02.pcap" and recognized the type of file that we could read with WireShark.
To do so, we copied the file on our local machine with the following command "scp -P 4242 level02@snow-crash:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap /Users/Stina/Documents/42_Projects/Code/snow-crash".
In WireShark, we could see that the file contains a conversation between two computers.
We "Followed" the TCP stream and found "wwwbugs login: l.le.ev.ve.el.lX.X" and "Password: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L".
The password did not work, so we were verifying what the "." in between the Password signify. 
When we checked each connection, we found out that each lettter of the Password is always the last byte of the package. The dots have a hex value of 7F, which is DEL in ascii code.
We then tried to reproduce the conversation : ft_wandr(DEL)(DEL)(DEL)NDRel(DEL)L0L which results in ft_waNDReL0L
Success, the password lets us log into flag02.
